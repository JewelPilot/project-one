        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Second year ITM major at Illinois Institute of Technology
          with plans of going deeper into cybersecuirity and web developement. I was good
          in maths during high school which helped in my SAT and admission into IIT. Prior
          coming to IIT I wanted to study maths but it was very limiting so I started
          learning programming some months before entering IIT. I am from Nigeria, where I
          learnt everything I now know and I am from a family of 6 with 2 brothers,  a sister
          and my parents.
